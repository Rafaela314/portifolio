## This project corresponds to a portifolio to present my self and the most recent works/projects I have developed.


### This project was an experiment with a given template by Uiicooks. I wanted to understand better the principles of a good frontend design so a dedicated time to understand how things were connected and adapted the template to a portifolio on my own.

### I also learned how to build an express server to deploy the website on Heroku. 

### check out the result here: `https://rafacavalcante.herokuapp.com`
